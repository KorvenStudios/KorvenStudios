Hey there, I’m Matthew Schuster, or @KorvenStudios! I'm a 21 year old college student with a CS major (specialization in digital forensics).
I’m interested in games and the design processes behind them. I’m currently learning GameMaker Studio 2's interface and programming language to develop a game of my own, called "Avalon Chronicles"!
